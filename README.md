The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game project is developed using Python.  The project file contains image files and a Python script.  The graphics of the game are good enough and the controls are simple for the users. In this mini project, the first turn is for the player and the player has to select any of those three shapes, that is-  Rock (image with a closed fist) Paper (image with flat hand) Scissors (image with the closed fist)
